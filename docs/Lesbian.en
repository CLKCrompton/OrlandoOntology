Enters the English language in 1890 as an adjective and 1925 as a noun.

A woman who is sexually attracted to other women. The concept is co-occurrent with the notion of sexuality as an identity, largely replacing the cultural practice of describing women's actions ("sapphic love, sapphism") with a description of their persons.
