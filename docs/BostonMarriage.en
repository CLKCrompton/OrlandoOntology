Enters the English language c.1875

Like women in a romantic friendship, women in a Boston marriage were in a monogamous emotional relationship with one another, that may or may not have involved sex.  Unlike many romantic friends, women in Boston marriages lived together and were often university-educated, committed to social causes, and financially independent (either through employment or through inheritance). The concept is co-occurrent with the notion of sexuality as an identity but women in Boston marriages were more likely to anchor their identity to their education or social work than their sexuality.

Now outdated.
