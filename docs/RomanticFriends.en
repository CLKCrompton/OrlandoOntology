Enters the English language c. 1750

An often non-genital but generally monogamous relationship between women, romantic friendship was not only socially acceptable but also idealized between 1750 and 1910.  While ideally romantic friends would live together, the ideal was hard to attain without economic independence. The concept predates the notion of sexuality as an identity.

Now outdated.
