Enters the English language in 1633, is used to charge Mary Hamilton for having sexual relationships with other women in 1746 (and was used, perhaps, earlier c.1746-?).

Masculine women who had genital sexual relationships with other women were occasionally charged with bigamy or with "monopolizing their own sex."  The offence seemed to stem from being masculine, since during the same period romantic friendships were socially acceptable. The concept predates the notion of sexuality as an identity.

Now outdated.
