Enters the English language in 1892.

Originating in medical discourse, the term homosexual refers to people who are attracted to others of the same sex. While the term originates with Richard Krafft-Ebing, who argued that same-sex desire was congenital, by the 1920s the term connoted the Freudian claim that same-sex desire was the result of childhood experience (often trauma). 

Now outdated/offensive. Still occasionally used in medical contexts.
