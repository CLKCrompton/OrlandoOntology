A Place is a immovable location that may be named, habited or not and
incorporated or not.  The chief difference between a place and region is the
amount of surface area.

A place is a problematic thing, ill defined agiants an area. 


The Geonames definition of a place is a populated location, through it might
be abandoned.

The DBPedua notion of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place">place</a> is also compatible.

Schema.org downgrades this to "Somewhat fixed" for <a href="http://schema.org/Place">Place</a>
